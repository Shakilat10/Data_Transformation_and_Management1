# Overview
This project includes performing data preparation, transformation, migration, and backup tasks using a retail e-commerce sales dataset. The goal is to analyze and manupulate the data,
integrate it into a non-relational database (MongoDB), and make data export, migration to the cloud smoothly, and backup processes.

# Objectives
Data Transformation: Clean and transform a messy dataset into a tidy format for further analysis.
Database Integration: Import data into NoSQL database (MongoDB) for correctly querying and storage.
Data Export and Backup: Export data from MongoDB, upload it to a Google Colab, and automate backup processes to ensure data security.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into two main tasks:
- Data Preparation and Database Integration: including data loading, cleaning, and transformation using Python.
  Database connection with MongoDB and data import and filtering and sorting records within the MongoDB database.
- Data Export, Migration, and Backup: Exporting data from MongoDB to local system then uploading exported data to cloud storage services like Google Colab.
  After that, automating cloud backups for data safety by using Google Drive.
